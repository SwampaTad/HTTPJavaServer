# A Simple HTTP Server Project
This HTTP Server was written in Java. It's purpose is to display data and time when connection to the server is successful,
but it's main purpose was to help me practice my Java.

## Lessons Learned:
As I already have a bit of experience in Java, it was just a refresher, however I have familiarized myself
on how to connect to a server, as well as accepting that connection and actually doing something with the 
server after connection.

## Technologies Used:
Java
